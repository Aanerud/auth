Sure, I'll provide a detailed `README.md` that includes instructions on the necessary variable replacements, how to set the startup script, and the steps to deploy the app on Azure WebApps.

# Azure AD Authentication with Flask WebApp

This project demonstrates the process of moving from an on-premises Active Directory (AD) setup to a cloud-based Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It includes synchronizing directories, enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and using a Flask web application to host OAuth 2.0 authentication for third-party applications.

## Process Overview

1. **Setup Azure AD Directory**
   - Create an Azure AD Directory if you don't already have one.

2. **Sync On-Premises AD with Azure AD**
   - Use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your on-premises AD with Azure AD.
   - Follow the [Azure AD Connect setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-roadmap) for detailed steps.

3. **Enable MFA on All Accounts**
   - Once synchronization is complete, enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts.
   - Users can set up their MFA by visiting [https://aka.ms/mfasetup](https://aka.ms/mfasetup).

4. **Authenticate Locally with Azure AD**
   - After enabling MFA, you can authenticate with your Azure AD credentials.
   - This ensures that all local accounts can now use the enhanced security features provided by Azure AD.

5. **Deploy Flask WebApp for OAuth 2.0 Authentication**
   - Use the provided Flask web application to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication.
   - This web app can act as an OAuth host for third-party applications running internally, providing secure access to resources.

## Deployment

### 1. Prepare the Code

Ensure you have the following files in your repository:

- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `startup.sh`

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Replace placeholders in `app.py` with your actual values:

- `{CLIENT_ID}`: Your Azure AD app's client ID.
- `{CLIENT_SECRET}`: Your Azure AD app's client secret.
- `{TENANT_ID}`: Your Azure AD tenant ID.
- `{AzureWebApp_Name}`: Your Azure Web App's name.

### 3. Set Startup Command

To configure the startup command for your Azure Web App, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure Portal and navigate to your Web App.
2. Under the "Settings" section, select "Configuration".
3. Click on "General settings".
4. Set the "Startup Command" to `startup.sh`.
5. Save the configuration.

Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI to set the startup command:

```sh
az webapp config set --resource-group <YourResourceGroup> --name <YourWebAppName> --startup-file "startup.sh"
```

### 4. Deploy to Azure Web App

Use the following Azure CLI command to deploy your Flask application:

```sh
az webapp up --name <YourWebAppName> --runtime "PYTHON:3.11"
```

Ensure that you replace `<YourWebAppName>` with the actual name of your Azure Web App.

### 5. Configure Redirect URIs

Ensure your Azure AD application registration has the correct redirect URI:

1. Navigate to your Azure AD app registration in the Azure Portal.
2. Go to "Authentication" under the "Manage" section.
3. Add the redirect URI: `https://<YourWebAppName>.azurewebsites.net/getAToken`.

### 6. Run the Application

After deploying, your Flask application should be up and running on Azure Web Apps. You can authenticate users using Azure AD.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a secure way to integrate on-premises AD with Azure AD, enabling MFA and using OAuth 2.0 authentication for third-party applications. By leveraging Azure AD and Flask, you can enhance security and streamline authentication across your organization.
